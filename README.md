This is where all the planning and design for my future application in Mobile Portfolio 2 can be found.

## Intro
I started with going to miro and using a preset for brainstorming on a 1 - 8 page document. I used collaboration with other people to get feedback on my ideas and improve what I was working on. 

## Version Control
I am going to be using a private repository in GitHub to track all of my changes and commits while I develop this app. I am currently in the **inception** phase. You can visit my *miro* site that is running live [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kx-YShQ=/). 

## Inception Phase
I am currently in the **inception** phase. As Benjmain has quoted:
> Planning to fail is failing to plan.


So far we have covered how to create repositories, brainstorm in teams and get feedback, and use tools like **miro** and **GenMyModel**.
